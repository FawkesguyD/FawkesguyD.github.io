### Grid Layout Overview

The Grid Layout in CSS is a powerful technique for creating complex and responsive web layouts. It allows developers to define rows and columns on their webpages, place items within these areas, and control the sizing, spacing, and alignment of these items. Below is a detailed explanation of a specific Grid Layout defined by CSS properties, focusing on the `grid-template-areas` and related properties.

#### Basic Grid Structure

In the provided CSS, the grid is set up on the `body` element, turning the entire body of the web page into a grid container. Here's how the grid is defined:

```css
body {
    display: grid;
    grid-template-columns: repeat(9, 1fr);
    grid-auto-rows: 50px auto 50px;
    grid-template-areas: 
        "hd hd hd hd hd hd hd hd hd"
        "sb sb mn mn mn mn mn mn mn"
        "ft ft ft ft ft ft ft ft ft";
    column-gap: 0.5rem;
}
```

#### grid-template-columns

This property defines the columns of the grid. Here, `repeat(9, 1fr)` sets up nine columns, each taking one fraction of the available space (`1fr`).

#### grid-auto-rows

This sets the height of the rows. `50px auto 50px` specifies the height of each row, with the first and last rows being 50px high, and the middle row adjusting automatically to the content size.

#### grid-template-areas

This property defines a template by referring to names of areas which are specified later in individual elements. The layout is divided into three horizontal areas across nine columns:

- `"hd hd hd hd hd hd hd hd hd"`: All nine columns in the first row are assigned to the header (`hd`).
- `"sb sb mn mn mn mn mn mn mn"`: The first two columns in the second row are assigned to the sidebar (`sb`), and the remaining seven columns to the main content area (`mn`).
- `"ft ft ft ft ft ft ft ft ft"`: All nine columns in the third row are assigned to the footer (`ft`).

#### column-gap

This property sets the gap between the columns to `0.5rem`, providing spacing between the columns of the grid.

### Element Positioning Using Grid Areas

The `.header`, `.sidebar`, and `.footer` classes are assigned specific grid areas using the `grid-area` property, mapping them to the respective areas defined in `grid-template-areas`:

```css
.header {
    grid-area: hd;
}

.sidebar {
    grid-area: sb;
}

.footer {
    grid-area: ft;
}
```

#### grid-column & grid-row
The CSS properties `grid-column` and `grid-row` are used within the CSS Grid Layout to specify where a grid item should be placed in terms of columns and rows. These properties are shorthand for `grid-column-start`/`grid-column-end` and `grid-row-start`/`grid-row-end` respectively. Let's break down what each part of the provided code means:
![grid_view](/content/grid_view.png)
### grid-column: 1 / 4;

This property specifies the start and end positions of a grid item across the grid columns. 

- **`1`**: This value indicates that the grid item should start at the first vertical line of the grid (i.e., the very beginning of the first column).
- **`4`**: This value indicates that the grid item should end before the fourth vertical line of the grid (spans across columns 1, 2, and 3).

Thus, `grid-column: 1 / 4;` means the item will occupy three columns, from the first column to before the start of the fourth column.

### grid-row: 1 / 3;

This property specifies the start and end positions of a grid item across the grid rows.

- **`1`**: This value indicates that the grid item should start at the third horizontal line of the grid (i.e., the beginning of the third row).
- **`3`**: This value indicates that the grid item should end before the fifth horizontal line of the grid (spans across rows 3 and 4).


## grid-area: 1 / 2 / 3 / 4;

The `grid-area` property is a shorthand property that combines `grid-row-start`, `grid-column-start`, `grid-row-end`, and `grid-column-end`. It allows you to specify the position of a grid item within the grid in a more compact form. The syntax is as follows:

`grid-area: grid-row-start / grid-column-start / grid-row-end / grid-column-end;`

In this case, `grid-area: 1 / 2 / 3 / 4;` means the grid item will start from the first row and second column, and span until just before the third row and fourth column.
